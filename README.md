## Project Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end logging using the ELK Stack:
- A simple Flask app generates structured logs.
- Filebeat ships those logs to Logstash.
- Logstash parses and pushes them to Elasticsearch.
- Kibana displays real-time dashboards.

 Zero-cost deployment using local Docker containers.

## Log Volume Over Time Chart
This chart is based on a Vertical Bar Graph, on the X-axis we have the time @timestamp, and on the Y-axis we have the Count of Records 
Usage:
With this chart, we can keep track of the number of Records, aka the logs, we have received each day, or customize the time @timestamp by the preference of hour, minutes, days, or according to our needs.

## Log Level Breakdown
This Pie chart displays the breakdown of logs between info, errors or warnings which makes the personnel easily spot on the errors or warnings through the graphical color representation.
